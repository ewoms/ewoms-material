The ewoms-material module
=========================

This eWoms module implements thermodynamic relations, capillary
pressure laws and everything else that concerns the physical
properties of miscible and immiscible fluids and the media they are
engulfed in.

Installation
============

Like all eWoms modules, ewoms-material uses the DUNE build system to
handle the building and installation process. It is thus supposed to
be build using the `dunecontrol` utility. Please confer to the [INSTALL](https://github.com/ewoms/ewoms-common/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
file located in the ewoms-common module for detailed build
instructions.
